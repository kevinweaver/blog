# blog

An ideal blog tool is one that:

1. Syncronizes with all of my devices seemlessly.
1. Allows me to use a WYSIWYG to write from my phone.
1. Allows me to use vim to write markdown from my laptops.
1. Posts are privately encrypted by default, but integrates with [Steem](steemit.com) and [Medium](medium.com) to make posts public.
1. Integrates with [Twitter](twitter.com) to share a link to the post.

This is not that tool.
